# JobYar - Flutter resume builder

JobYar is a cross-platform online resume builder designed for wide accessibility, deployable as both a native Android app and a Progressive Web App (PWA) from a single Flutter codebase.
The application was architected to be scalable and maintainable, leveraging Provider for state management and GetIt for dependency injection to ensure clean code and testability.

A core technical achievement of this project was authoring a custom, high-fidelity PDF generation engine entirely in Dart.
This innovative approach guaranteed pixel-perfect template rendering across all platforms and completely eliminated any reliance on third-party libraries, giving us full control over the final output.
